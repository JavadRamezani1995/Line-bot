Hello, I want to build a Line Bot. I want to use it to buy and sell various products. Please modify the code below for me so I can implement 9 diverse categories that include the following: 1. Electronics and Gadgets: Smartphone, Wireless Headphones, Smartwatch 2. Fashion and Apparel: T-shirt, Sneakers, Handbag 3. Beauty and Personal Care: Facial Serum, Lipstick, Shampoo 4.

By the way, I don't know anything about coding and don't understand it. Please write the complete code so I can just copy and paste it. (I only know how to find and paste the Ngrok Token, Channel access token, and Channel secret). My environment is Google Colab. Keep in mind that LINE allows a maximum of 20 characters for the label for Carousel buttons.
